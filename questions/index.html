Although abacus users have the capability to do complex mathematics, it is the discipline itself that trains students to expect more from themselves. A well trained abacus master does not need a physical abacus, rather they visualize one and manipulate the beads mentally. This level of skill is achieved through years of daily training; however, it is never too early to start working on visualization skills. It is popular to send young children to study the abacus in an attempt to increase their visual memory, expose them to new challenges and give them a head start in math. Learning to use an abacus instills good study practices that students can carry with them through their life. </p> </div> </section> <section> <div> <h2>Where to Begin Learning Abacus?</h2> <p>While it is possible to self-teach abacus, most students join one of the many abacus clubs in their area. Either way, it is a years-long commitment that requires daily practice to progress to new skills. Students can get started with the <a href="/progressive-abacus/beginner">Abacus Fundamentals Course</a> so they can sum any three-digit numbers on the abacus in preparation for more advanced math. This is great supplemental material for those who join an abacus club to get some extra practice.</p> <p>Every abacus school is unique so it is ideal to meet with instructors from different clubs to discus expectations. One key point to investigate is their approach to teaching visualization skills and at what level it is introduced. Some teach students to visualize the abacus from the very beginning and other schools leave it for more advanced users. There is also a lot of variation in finger movement techniques from school-to-school with some schools using only two fingers and others using two hands. Classes can be costly but do provide an established stepwise process to move through.</p> </div> </section> </content> </div> <div> <footer> <div> </div> <div> <p>Created by <a href='/' target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Alice Green</a> &copy; 2019</p> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="../javascripts/site.js"></script> <script src="../javascripts/header.js"></script> </body> </html>
